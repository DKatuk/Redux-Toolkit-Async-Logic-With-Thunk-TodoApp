It's a simple todo list app built by React, Redux ( Redux Toolkit) and Thunk middleware.
All the async logic was done by using Thunk middleware. 
You can;
- Add a new todo
- Delete a todo
- Update todo status ( toggle between completed to uncompleted)
- See how many uncompleted todos left
- Filter todos by their **active** and **completed** status
- Clear all the completed todos with a button
